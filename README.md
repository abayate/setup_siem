<h1> Setup SIEM Microsoft Azure </h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
Project involved developing custom PowerShell scripts to extract metadata from Windows Event Viewer and send it to a third-party API for geolocation analysis. 
This data was then ingested into Microsoft Azure Log Analytics Workspace, where custom fields and Azure Sentinel workbooks were configured to map and display global attack data, such as RDP Brute Force attempts, on a world map. 
The setup provided a visual representation of attack locations and magnitudes, enhancing security monitoring and analysis.

## Tasks Performed

- **PowerShell Scripting for Event Data Extraction:**
  - Developed custom PowerShell scripts to extract metadata from Windows Event Viewer logs.

- **Azure Sentinel Workbooks Configuration:**
  - Created custom fields and workbooks within Azure Sentinel in Log Analytics.
  - Visualized global attack data (e.g., RDP Brute Force) on a world map.
  - Mapped attack locations and magnitudes to provide a clear visual representation of global security threats.
emented quotas for storage management.
